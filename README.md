# GIG-Contributions
The work that I contributed to the Genderless In Germany project/research.

The work provided in this repository was done either by myself or with my teammates. This is a non-official Unity Project of the game with a PC demo inside the PageSysTester folder. The project/demo does not work the same as the final version of the game, to which I do not have access to anymore.

* Note that the Unity project itself is called PageSysTester since, when I started coding for the game, we were testing out the scene/page traversal and this was my first time using Unity.
