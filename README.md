# GIG-Contributions
The work that I contributed to the Genderless In Germany project/research.

Note: The work provided in this repository was done by me alone. This work is a part of a greater project (the game itself) to which I have no rights to share. However, I have the right to share these files as they were created by me without having signed any contracts, agreements, or any other kind of legal documents.

Therefore, I am sharing the designs and sketches of the characters and settings (not all of them were used in the game), scene-views(without UI), and the script of the first level.

Note that while I'm sharing .JPEG files of the designes, the actual files used in the game were in .PNG format because of Unity's requirements.
